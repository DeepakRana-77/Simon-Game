üéÆLevel Up Your Memory with ' The Simon Game '!üß†

Hey everyone!!

I am thrilled to share my latest project , the Simon Says Game ! It's a memory based challenge designed to test and improve your cognitive abilities . ‚ú®‚ú®

I built this game from scratch using HTML ,CSS and JavaScript. It was an amazing opportunity to showcase my front end web development skills and create a fully responsive , interactive and engaging project.

üéÆ How to Play:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Press "Start" to initiate the game. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Simon will show a sequence will colored lights and sounds. 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Your task is repeat the sequence shown by passing the button in the order they were shown. 
4Ô∏è‚É£ As you succeed, the sequence will get longer and faster. 
 5Ô∏è‚É£ If you press a button out of sequence, the game will end, and you 'll hear an error sound. Your score will be displayed. 
After each complete sequence your level will increase by one but if you press wrong button which is not a part of sequence then the game will be over and your score will display .
